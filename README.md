## üöÄ Features

- **One-to-One Relationships**: Manage single associations between entities.
- **One-to-Many Relationships**: Handle relationships where one entity maps to multiple entities.
- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Map entities that have multiple associations with each other.
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: Manage two-way relationships between entities.
- **Inheritance Mappings**: Utilize inheritance strategies for entity hierarchies.

Explore the powerful features of this advanced mapping system:

### 1. **One-to-One Relationships**

Demonstrates how to create and manage one-to-one associations between entities.

### 2. **One-to-Many Relationships**

Illustrates the management of one-to-many relationships, where a single entity is related to multiple other entities.

### 3. **Many-to-Many Relationships**

Shows how to handle many-to-many associations, where entities are related to multiple other entities.

### 4. **Bidirectional Relationships**

Handles two-way relationships between entities, including how to manage and persist such relationships.

### 5. **Inheritance Mappings**

Demonstrates various inheritance strategies such as `Single Table`, `Table Per Class`, and `Joined` for entity hierarchies.

## üìñ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- Maven or Gradle installed
- MySQL or another supported relational database
- Your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## ‚ú® Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

You can use Spring Initializr to generate a basic Spring Boot project. Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and configure your project with the following settings:

* Project: Maven Project
* Language: Java
* Spring Boot: Latest stable version
* Packaging: Jar
* Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver

Click on "Generate" to download the project zip file.

### Step 2: Extract and Import into IDE

Extract the downloaded zip file and import the project into your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

### Step 3: Define Entities

Create entity classes representing the data models and their relationships. For example, you might define `User`, `Order`, and `Product` classes with various relationships.

### Step 4: Create Repositories

Create repository interfaces for your entities to perform CRUD operations and manage relationships.

### Step 5: Create Services and Controllers

Implement services to handle business logic and controllers to manage HTTP requests and responses.

### Step 6: Configure Frontend (Optional)

If you need a user interface, you can create a simple frontend using Thymeleaf or another templating engine.

### Step 7: Run Your Application

Run your Spring Boot application. It will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`.
